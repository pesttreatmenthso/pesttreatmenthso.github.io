<p>The professional user ought to keep making use of pesticides and other types of intervention to levels that are required, e.g. by lowered doses, lowered application frequency or partial applications, thinking about that the level of threat in plant life is appropriate and they do not increase the threat for advancement of resistance in populations of hazardous organisms.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not take off due to the fact that growers were not ready for such an intercropping arrangement.
