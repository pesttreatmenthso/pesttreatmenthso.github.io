Biological pathogens: Bacillus thuringiensis, also known as Bt, is a soil-borne bacterium that battles mosquitoes and insects in the larval, caterpillar phase.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production applies much of the same ideas as IPM but restricts the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to reduce the need for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides. </p>
