<p>Think about alternative techniques (aside from pesticides) to make your home and garden unattractive to pests. With IPM, you take actions to keep pests from ending up being a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can hold up against pest attacks, utilizing disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from entering a building. Current missions for effective, safe, and long lasting pest management programs have been targeted primarily towards advancement of brand-new and better products with which to change traditional harmful pesticides.</p>

While moving into a brand-new house or apartment, invest and get an expert evaluation into a preventive termite control service, like that of HiCare.</p>
